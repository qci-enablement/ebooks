    "# QLCBO formulation\n",
    "#### Device: Dirac-1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Quadratic Linearly Constrained Binary Optimization, or QLCBO, is a fundamental building block for optimizing where the primary goal is maximizing or minimizing a function that has both quadratic terms (involving pairwise products of decision variables) and linear constraints (applied to sums of terms). Furthermore, QLCBO problems serve as fundamental building blocks for more complex optimization models that can address many real world problems. This tutorial will go through why QLCBOs are valuable, what they can do, and how to run such problems on QCi's Dirac entropy computing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the QLCBO formulation allows a combination of the types of constraints that more typically appear in traditional computer science, as well as quadratic terms that naturally arise in physics-based hardware such as ours. Note that if the $O$ matrix is diagonal then QLCBO reduces to standard binary linear programming, but the off-diagonal terms allow the quadratic interactions that are native to our device to be added. This could be useful for example if formulating a [quadratic knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_knapsack_problem) with a global constraint on weights but a quadratic objective function. Terms of this form tend to arise because physical interactions are naturally two-body. By providing a way to effectively use a binary linear programming problem as a starting point, the QLCBO formulation allows a natural way to start with an existing model and then add complexity. This may correspond to the kind of quadratic terms on which systems like ours excel, and provide a bridge from a linear programming setting that may be more familiar to some of our users to a quadratic setting that is more natural for quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its versatility and the sample constraint function, our software implementation of QLCBO is the workhorse of many tutorial examples using Dirac-1, and is likely to be the same for many of your use cases. The following tutorials and use cases rely on constructing a QLCBO problem:\n",

    "## Mathematical Definition\n",
    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems can be formulated from a square, symmetric objective function and a matrix of binary constraints. Suppose we are given an objective function, $O$, of dimension $n \\times n$,  and a set of $m$ constraints, represented by the matrix $A$, with dimension $m \\times n$ and right-hand side vector $b$ of length $m$. We want to combine them into a QUBO, which can be defined as $Q = O + \\alpha (A^T A-2\\mathrm{diag}(b^TA))$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. At this point, we can find an optimal solution,\n",
    "$x^{*} = \\min_{x} x^T Q x$. \n",
    "The parameter $\\alpha$ plays an important role in guaranteeing that the constraints are satisfied. We will not go into more detail on this page, but we will define a simple problem on the Upload tab and show how to upload the components.\n",
    "Suppose the original problem we want to minimize is \n",
    "$-3xy + xz,$\n",
    "subject to the constraints $x + z = 1$ and  $2x + 2y= 2$.\n"

    "In this tutorial, we have shown how to make use of the quadratic linearly constrained optimization formulation of problems. By combining quadratic objective functions with linear constraints, QLCBOs provide a powerful and versatile setting for formulating problems. These problems act as a workhorse for many of our other examples and prove to be particularly valuable as the problem size increases. If you feel comfortable with the QLCBO formulation and want to go further, a good next step is to see how it works in practice through the tutorials listed in this [module](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/module/understanding-qlcbos). Another alternative would be to work through examples using the unconstrained version [QUBO](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qubo-on-dirac). Of course, you could also try out some of your own problems."
