    "# Dirac-3 Developer Beginner Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac-3 is the latest addition to QCi's Entropy Quantum Computing (EQC) product line, a unique quantum-hardware approach for tackling complex optimization problems. Dirac-3 uses qudits as its unit of quantum information, where each quantum state is represented by $d$ dimensions. This means that Dirac-3 can solve problems beyond binary (0,1), including integers and continuous numbers (all positive real rational numbers). For further information on qudits, please read through the [Qudit Primer](https://learn.quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/lessons/qudit-basics) to better understand the benefits of high-dimensional programming. This allows Dirac-3 to solve a variety of important problems including higher order polynomials as well as integer optimization problems. This tutorial will provide an introduction to how to formulate problems for Dirac-3. We will begin by discussing what types of problems Dirac-3 can solve, how to submit problems, and how to analyze results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To delve deeper into the underlying physics of EQC technology, refer to our paper: [An Open Quantum System for Discrete Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04512)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: In order to begin running problems with Dirac-3 you will need to: \n",
    "- [Install qci-client](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/quick-start-on-cloud#installation)\n",

    "## Dirac-3 as a Continuous Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac-3 solves problems of objective function minimization for optimization over discrete spaces by finding the ground state of a complex system with many inter-correlated variables. They correspond to minimizing the expected return of the following objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i V_i +\n",
    "\\sum_{i,j=1}^{N,N} J_{ij}V_i V_j +\n",
    "\\sum_{i,j,k=1}^{N,N,N} T_{ijk}V_i V_j V_k +\n",
    "\\sum_{i,j,k,l=1}^{N,N,N,N} Q_{ijkl}V_i V_j V_k V_l +\n",
    "\\sum_{i,j,k,l,m=1}^{N,N,N,N,N} P_{ijklm}V_i V_j V_k V_l V_m\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $V_{i}$ is the value of each continuous variable with the expected resolution of $\\frac{R}{\\text{dynamic range}}$, $C_{i}$ is the linear return of each variable which must be real numbers, $J_{ij}$ , $T_{ijk}$ , $Q_{ijkl}$ , $P_{ijklm}$ are joint returns of variables which must be real numbers, and $R$ is the constraint summation satisfying 1 ≤ $R$.\n",
    "Dirac-3 allows direct submission for minimization only. It is assumed that users perform a simple transformation before submitting the problem to handle maximization (i.e. multiply coefficients by -1).
