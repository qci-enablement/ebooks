For more information on the tests, see [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation/documentation-and-software). The device is configured to run all tests on 10 bitstreams of 1 million bits each. Each health test takes roughly 10 minutes to run. However, the device will be available during health testing because after samples are collected, the health tests will run in the background. There are two methods to initiate a health test: on demand and through the scheduling system. When a health test starts, it clears the results of the previous test to prevent users from retrieving outdated information. Below is example code to wait for an on-demand health test:"

    "\n",
    "In conducting randomness tests, it is not uncommon to observe occasional failures due to random chance. To mitigate this phenomenon, adjustments such as analyzing multiple tests and observing the distribution of p-values are often employed. If failures are repeatedly observed in the same test, this raises concerns about the underlying entropy. Additionally, the sample size used is crucial in determining the overall validity of a battery of tests. It is important to consider the number of tests being run and apply an appropriate multiple test correction to the resulting p-values. Since most entropy tests are statistical in nature, it is important to remember that even a true random number generator (tRNG) will occasionally fail a test when a sufficient number of tests are conducted, due to the inherent probabilities of false positives. For further guidance, QCi recommends reading Chapter 10 of the book *Beautiful Testing*, available as a [free PDF](https://www.johndcook.com/Beautiful_Testing_ch10.pdf). For further guidance on appropriate testing methodology and implementation for randomness testing, we also offer paid consulting services.
