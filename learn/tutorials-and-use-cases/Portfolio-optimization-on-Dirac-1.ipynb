    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach seeks to identify a sub-portfolio of stocks that have superior risk-return profiles compared to the full portfolio. This identifies opportunities for an investor to simplify their investment strategy without sacrificing (and potentially enhancing) the risk-adjusted return. While the expected return on a portfolio is relatively straightforward to optimize by itself, optimizing against risk is more subtle when choosing a set of assets that individually have high returns. The reason that optimizing against risk is more challenging is because asset performances can be correlated. Intuitively, one can see that investing in two highly-correlated assets is more risky than if they are uncorrelated or even anti-correlated. If one of a highly correlated asset is performing poorly, the other in the pair is likely to do so as well. Thus, the variance of a portfolio with both assets can be significantly higher than it would be if they were uncorrelated. Minimizing the overall variance for the return of a portfolio therefore needs to take into account the covariance between the assets, making this a fundamentally quadratic problem, ideal for our Dirac-1 solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Investments need not only give a good return on average, but also need to balance the potential risks. This balance will depend on the goal of the investor. For example, someone investing their retirement fund is likely to favor modest returns with low risks because the consequences of major losses are severe. On the other hand, someone who is day-trading in the hopes of having more money for entertainment might be willing to take more risks. There are of course many other scenarios with other risk levels. In general, the portfolio optimization problem is viewed as being a multi-objective problem. The goal is to balance the objective of maximizing return with the objective of minimizing risk. Even with multiple objectives there is still a sense of optimality, a portfolio is said to be \"efficient\" or \"[Pareto optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimizationy)\" if the only ways to decrease risk would be to also decrease return. Regardless of one's appetite for risk, it never makes sense to invest in a non-Pareto-Optimal portfolio, so our goal is to find those that are Pareto optimal and match the appetite for risk which is parameterized by a term  $\\xi$ in our description. It is worth noting that this tutorial is based on a relatively simplified but still commonly used model of portfolio optimization. Various efforts exist to take into account more complex structure in the distribution of expected returns, in particular [the failure to capture extreme events](http://math.bu.edu/people/murad/pub/hist11-posted.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolios diversification is necessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes for investors, making the kind of portfolio optimization discussed here (and potentially more complex variants) highly important. In spite of its simplicity, the model of diversification presented here, often referred to as [modern portfolio](https://www.britannica.com/money/modern-portfolio-theory-explained) theory, is [still used](https://www.nutmeg.com/nutmegonomics/markowitzs-legacy-why-modern-portfolio-theory-still). Improvements of the models presented here comprise a subject known as [post-modern portfolio theory](http://actuaries.org/AFIR/Colloquia/Orlando/Ferguson_Rom.pdf). One improvement is to consider a quantity known as [downside risk](https://www.lehigh.edu/~xuy219/research/Downside.pdf) instead of variance. Downside risk only takes into account the risk of portfolio elements underperforming a goal, rather than their total variation. Since the goal of diversification is to protect from risk, this approach can yield better performance.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Let K be the total number of available stocks to choose from (here $K = 253$), that is the size of the stock pool. We want to choose a subset of $K^\\prime$  ($K^\\prime < K$) stocks such that the portfolio risk is minimized, while the portfolio expected return is maximized, that is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min_{\\{x_{i}\\}_{i \\in \\{1, 2,..., K\\}}} [-E(R)^2 + \\xi VAR(R)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the daily returns of the portfolio over some period of time, $VAR(R)$ and $E(R)$ are the variance and expectation of daily returns, $\\xi$ is a hyper-parameter, and $\\{x_{i}\\}$ are binary variables representing inclusion or exclusion of a stock. A large value means the focus of optimization is to increase return, whereas a small value indicates the reduction of risk is more important. As we can take both long and short positions on stocks, we assume that $x_1, x_2, ..., x_K$ corresponds to long positions on stocks 1 to $K$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are choosing a subset of $K^\\prime$ stocks, we also need the following constraint,\n",

    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{K} x_i = K^\\prime$\n",

    "$E(R^{(m)}) = \\frac{1}{K^\\prime} \\sum_{i=1}^{K} x_i E(r^{(m)}_i)$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $COV$ is the covariant function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem then reduces to\n",
