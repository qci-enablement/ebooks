    "# Set Partitioning on Dirac\n",

    "## introduction\n",
    "The set partitioning problem is an optimization problem which selects sets $S_i$ from a collection $S$ such that each member $x\\in X=\\bigcup_i S_i$ is included in exactly one $S_i$ of the selected sets (see [Operations Research Journal Vol. 17, No. 5](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.17.5.848)). It has applications in logistics, design, manufacturing and scheduling, among others. In more mathematical literature, the set partioning problem is sometimes referred to as exact cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set partitioning problem is formulated by creating constraints which specify that only one out of all the sets $S_i$ of which a particular member $s$ is selected. This looks like\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i,x\\in S_i} s_i = 1\\quad \\forall x\\in X\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $s_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$ indicates set $S_i$ is selected. In addition to a constraint for each member, there is an objective function which measures the cost, weight or benefit of selecting certain sets from $S$. The objective function could be any form, but we can solve linear or quadratic objective functions with Dirac. A quadratic objective function has coefficients $c_{ij},c_{i}$ for quadratic and linear terms, respectively. With the variables $s_i$, we have\n",

    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "While the problem of set partioning may first seem esoteric, the underlying concepts are actually quite natural and arise often (as discussed below), as do closely related problems. It also has a natural constraint structure which appears often in many problems (one-hot constraints) enforcing that that each member of each set is included once and only once. Unlike the double-one-hot constraints seen for example in [travelling salesperson](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/traveling-salesperson-on-dirac) or the [quadratic assignment problem](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/quadratic-assignment-on-dirac), the one-hot constraints here do not form a regular structure, but do overlap since each set will have one constraint for each element in the set. A natural generalisation of set partitioning is set cover, where the goal is to find the minimum weight configuration where each element is included at least once but may be duplicated.\n"

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "One perhaps surprising application to set partitioning is [corporate tax structuring](https://digital.case.edu/islandora/object/ksl%3AweaopeTM0362), while the details of this use case are not worth explaining, the set partitioning constriants originate from the fact that subsidiaries can be combined for tax purposes, but each of subsidiary cannot be contained in more than one conglomorate, but has to be contained somewhere. Another application is [airline crew scheduling](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/exact-solution-crew-scheduling-problems-using-set-partitioning-model) in this setting, the sets are different round trips which could be assigned to a type of crew member exactly one of which is needed for each leg of a flight, this model streightforwardly extends to similar applications such as bus driver scheduling. \n"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we take a slightly different approach, which requires some explanation, we effectively formulate the set partioning problem as a [quadratic linearly constrianed binary optimisation problem](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qlcbo-on-dirac) (QLCBO), but we construct the constraints explicitly, instead of directly using the built-in constraint features of the software, instead sending the problem to the solver as a [quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qubo-on-dirac) problem. This tutorial effectively explicitly shows what the constrained solver will do for you behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With constraint-based solvers, it would be sufficient to implement the objective and constraints directly in the modeling or matrix format required by the solver, but an addition step is required for unconstrained solving, which we have elected to use in this example. Penalties can be created from the constraints $As=b$ using\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(s)=s^T(A^TA)s-(2b^TA)^Ts+b^Tb.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When all constraints are met, $P(s)=0$ and when any constraint is violated, $P(s)>0$. There is a difficulty in combining the objective function and penalties in that a scalar value of the objective function for a constraint violating solution could be less than 0 or at least less than the penalty, which results in a value of the total function less than 0. This will result in an optimizer finding an infeasible solution, unless a multiplier is applied to $P(s)$. Sufficiently large multipliers will guarantee that no infeasible solution will take on a value of the total function which is less than any value for a feasible solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a value which is known to be sufficient, $\\alpha$. We apply it to $P(s)$ to get the function\n",
