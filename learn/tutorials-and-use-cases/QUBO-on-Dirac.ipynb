    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are a class of optimization problems where the goal is to maximize or minimize a quadratic objective function without any constraints on the decision variables. Furthermore, QUBO problems serve as fundamental building blocks for more complex optimization models that can address many real-world problems. This tutorial will go through why QUBOs are valuable, what they can do, and how to run such problems on QCi's Dirac entropy computing systems.\n"

    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "QUBO encodings tend to naturally arise in quantum settings or any setting where variable interactions are directly encoded into physical interactions between bits. The reason for this is that physical interactions tend to naturally be two-body, while most constraints in computer science problems do not. For this reason, QUBOs are a natural underlying model to think about when using a wide variety of quantum optimization systems. Since QUBOs are formally NP-hard, it is technically possible to map any optimization problem to a QUBO. Efforts have been made to do so efficiently, for example, [this work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-022-04634-2) expresses many common problems as QUBOs with the aim of bridging to quantum technology. QUBOs can be used to construct the kinds of linear constraints often found in optimization problems, since automatic handling of such constraints is often very useful, we have also developed a related model, Quadratic Linearly Constrained Binary Optimisation (QLCBO), which is documented in [this tutorial](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qlcbo-on-dirac). This lesson however will focus on using the underlying unconstrained model."

    "\n",
    "QUBOs are fundamental in various fields, serving as a basis for formulating discrete combinatorial optimization problems. As an NP-hard problem, QUBO finds numerous applications across diverse domains, including machine learning, operations research, finance, chemistry, medicine, and beyond. In the realm of machine learning, its most effective applications thus far are observed in support vector machines (SVM) and clustering algorithms.

    "## Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) defined by second order interactions between binary variables with no constraints, is defined by linear and quadratic terms, but since $x^2 = x$ when $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we can simplify the optimization expression as such $f(x) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} J_{ij} x_i x_j$, where $f: \\mathbb{B}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Note that the coefficients naturally encode as a square symmetric matrix, so that $f(x) = x^T Q x$, where $Q$ has entries $Q_{ij}$. The goal of the optimization problem is to find the binary vector, $x^{*}$, that minimizes $f(x)$, \n",

    "\n",
    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) problems are the underlying model used by many quadratic solvers, based on physical interactions being naturally quadratic. Understanding QUBOs is therefore key to understanding how to solve problems on quantum hardware. Sometimes a slightly higher level of abstraction including constraints may also be useful, [QLCBO as explained in this lesson](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qlcbo-on-dirac). If you feel like you understand QUBOs and want to see how they are applied without engineering constraints then we encourage you to look at one of the lessons linked above. If however, your application includes constraints, you may wish to proceed to the QLCBO tutorial."
