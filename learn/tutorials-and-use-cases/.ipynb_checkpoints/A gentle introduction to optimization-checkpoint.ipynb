    "Entropy quantum computing (EQC) is an analog quantum computing paradigm for optimization. Optimization problems arise in many contexts, such as economics, drug discovery, finance, energy, supply chain, artificial intelligence (AI), transportation, and many more. While many users may be familiar with optimization, some may not be. The aim of this tutorial is to provide a guide for those who are not familiar with the topic, for a more in-depth discussion of combinatorial optimization, a particularly important subfield of optimization, please see [this lesson](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/lessons/combinatorial-optimization-problems)."

For further information on qudits, please read through the [Qudit Primer](https://learn.quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/lessons/qudit-basics) to better understand the benefits of high-dimensional programming.\n",

    "## What Is Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization starts with identifying goals: searching for the best solution from a range of options, such as maximizing profits, minimizing costs, finding the quickest route, or using resources efficiently. These goals are often referred to as the objective function, and less commonly in more physics oriented literature, energy."

    "Constraints are the rules or limitations, such as budget restrictions, time limits, or fuel constraints. Sometimes constraints are even just statements of physical realities, for example, that a travelling salesperson can only be in a single city at a time. They play a crucial role in optimization because they determine the maximum or minimum possibilities.\n",
