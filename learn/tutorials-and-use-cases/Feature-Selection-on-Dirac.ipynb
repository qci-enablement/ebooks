    "# Feature Selection on Dirac\n",
    "#### Device: Dirac-1\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In machine learning problems, we often have to start with a large number of features. We need a feature selection technique that can discover a relatively small subset of the most relevant features. In what follows, we present a tutorial on using QCi's technology to select a set of features by minimizing their inter-correlation. This is important because highly correlated features will, by definition, contain a large amount of redundant information. This approach can be used with any unsupervised machine learning approach, such as anomaly detection and clustering algorithms. Unlike [QBoost](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qboost-for-qubo) this is a pre-processing method for other tools, rather than an entire algorithm in itself. The problem in QBoost is to build the best classifier without constraint on the number of weak classifiers. The problem here is rather \"which $k$ features give the most independent information about these data?\"."

    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Within machine learning, a well known issue is the \"[curse of dimensionality](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0019-x)\", a space of data points with coordinates defined by different features. The dimension of this space grows with the number of features. For a human it is difficult to visualize beyond two or three dimensions, and although computers can do better by understanding high dimensional models, added dimensions still makes the problems more difficult to approach numerically. One particular problem which occurs especially when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples is that it is very easy to overfit. In other words, it can learn features that are actually just a statistical accident for the samples used, rather than a real underlying structure. Not every dimension is going to be equally useful in understanding the data, and some may contain effectively the same information. In a case where two features contain essentially the same information, then it only makes sense to keep one, even if the information is very important. When more than two are present, finding which to keep can become a complex optimization problem, of exactly the type our Dirac-1 device has been built to solve."

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection has a [number of applications](http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/763354.MIPRO_2015_JovicBrkicBogunovic.pdf) in most areas where machine learning can be applied. We choose a medicare prescription dataset for the example, but many other applications could be studied as well. One specific example is image classification, since there are nearly limitless types of data that can be extracted from an image and deciding which features can be useful is a highly important task. For example, in [this work](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/papers/bins_iccv01.pdf), it was found that only a small fraction of statistical features of an aerial image were relevant for determining if it contained a house, making feature selection very important for successful identification. A very different application is [disease prediction based on genetic markers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9580915/). In this case, feature selection is extremely important because genetic information contains a huge number of features, but it is difficult to obtain a large sample size for these kinds of studies. Naively using many more features than the number of samples is likely to make learning highly prone to overfitting. Another very different application is [industrial fault diagnosis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-015-0694-6). As with the other cases, data from various sensors in an industrial facility (a chemical plant for example) is plentiful. Selecting the correct features in these data to focus analysis on is therefore crucial, particularly when trying to distinguish between faults which are similar, or highly correlated."

    "This tutorial is an example of an application of quadratic linearly-constrained binary optimization. A tutorial of which is [available here](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qlcbo-on-dirac) and can give a number of other applications of this formalism. Another direction is to examine what can be done with the [unconstrained version](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qubo-on-dirac). Of course, you could also try applying Dirac to one of your own problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like [portfolio optimization](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/portfolio-optimization-on-dirac), [QBoost](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qboost-for-qubo), and [dimensionality reduction](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/dimensionality-reduction-on-dirac), this tutorial is a variation on the same theme of taking advantage of the correlation structure of an underlying data set. Such problems keep arising both because they have important applications, and because they are naturally expressed as QUBOs, given the importance of two-body correlations. Trying one of these tutorials is a natural next step."
