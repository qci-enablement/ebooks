    "# Quadratic Linearly Constrained Binary Optimization\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (Qubo) problems can be formulated from a square, symmetric objective function and a matrix of binary constraints. Suppose we are given an objective function, $O$, of dimension $n \\times n$,  and a set of $m$ constraints, represented by the matrix $A$, with dimension $m \\times n$ and right-hand side vector $b$ of length $m$. We want to combine them into a Qubo, which can be defined as $Q = O + \\alpha (A^T A-2\\mathrm{diag}(b^TA))$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. At this point, we can find an optimal solution,\n",
    "$x^{*} = \\min_{x} x^T Q x$. \n",
    "The parameter $\\alpha$ plays an important role in guaranteeing that the constraints are satisfied. We will not go into more detail on this page. \n",
    "We will define a simple problem on the Upload tab and show how to upload the components. The examples on the Running tab will describe how to run the constraint problem. \n",
    "Suppose the original problem we want to minimize is \n",
    "$-3xy + xz,$\n",
    "subject to the constraints $x + z = 1$ and  $2x + 2y= 2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading\n",
    "There are three matrix components that can be associated with to a constraint problem of this type. The objective function in matrix form, the linear constraints matrix, and an optional right-hand side (RHS) represent the linear constraints themselves. This can optionally be appended to the last column of the aforementioned constraints matrix. We will describe them and their upload formats in what follows. \n",
    "The objective matrix is written \n"
