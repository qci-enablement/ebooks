    "Continuous optimization helps in selecting and determining how much to invest in each stock. Unlike binary optimization, where you decide whether to include a stock or not (1 or 0), continuous optimization allows for more precise investment decisions by assigning continuous values to represent the proportion of your investment in each stock. This method helps create a well-diversified portfolio with varying levels of investment in different stocks to better manage risk and achieve desired returns.\n"

    "## Constructing our Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In our tutorial, we have historical datasets containing stock prices over a period of time. Our goal is to use these datasets to calculate important metrics such as [the rate of return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return), [expected return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_return), [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance), and [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance). By calculating these metrics for each stock in our portfolio, we gain insights into their performance and risk characteristics. Expected return helps us gauge potential profitability, variance quantifies the risk associated with individual stocks, and covariance indicates how stocks move relative to each other. These calculations are essential for making informed investment decisions aimed at optimizing returns while managing risk effectively.\n",

    "This involves continuous variables $ w_i $. To solve this on a quantum computer, we typically need to convert the problem into a format called Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) [1, 2]. This requires an additional embedding step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increased Problem Size and Accuracy-Complexity Trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting continuous variables into binary ones makes the problem much larger. Achieving higher accuracy requires more binary variables, which can exceed the hardware's capabilities, increasing both the complexity and the required dynamic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited Connectivity Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers often lack global connectivity, meaning not all qubits can interact directly. This necessitates mapping the problem onto the hardware's specific qubit arrangement, further increasing the problem size and the time needed to find a solution [3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Dirac-3\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac-3 quantum optimization machine offers a significant advantage over traditional methods. It can work directly with discrete variables encoded in a high-dimensional time-energy mode, allowing it to handle the portfolio optimization problem without needing the conversion step. This eliminates the issues related to limited connectivity and simplifies the optimization process."
